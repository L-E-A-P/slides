Re-mediating mario bertoncini's activity <br/> «and other useless things...»
interpretative practice through workshop notes <br/>from a teamwork experience

Thank you for letting us share our report on how we interpret and re-mediate Mario Bertoncini's work. My name is Marco Di Gasbarro and I am a percussionist.

* To begin, I will briefly introduce Mario Bertoncini and point out where you can find more information about him.
* Building on that, Alice will explain the extent to which Bertoncini's activity is already mediated in his works by the concept of the continuous workshop - the “botteghe d'arte” - an approach that raises questions of preservation and sustainability.
* She will then show how our interpretative practice in Lazzaro offers a necessary response, even if it does not fully solve the problem.
* Next, I will share excerpts from our concert, held in Rome last September 22, focusing on the process that frames it.
* After that, we will open the workshop notebook, introduce our version of the bottega, clarify how our approach unfolds, and explain the objectives of the process we call "operactivity."
* Finally, we will define our idea of uselessness and why it might actually help us.

We would like to thank Valeska Bertoncini - Mario's daughter, who curates his work after his passing in 2019 -, Fondazione Isabella Scelsi in Rome, where Bertoncini's instruments are kept, and Akademie der Künste in Berlin, where all the writings and scores are archived.

Mario Bertoncini's work spans from awarded interpretations of Scarlatti's piano sonatas to the John Cages' prepared piano of Sonatas et Interludes. He explored the full spectrum of compositional techniques, from traditional notation to the most experimental practices of device construction: *sound sculptures* that ranged from found objects to electric motors to wind harps. He produced theatre pieces (Spazio-Tempo, 1967-70), installations (Chain Reaction, 1973, in collab. with kinetic painter Peter Sedgley) instrumental solo (Istantanee, 1975-2008), small ensemble (Epitaffio, 1968), featuring sculptures of various size, from the Aeolian Lyras (Streichquartett, 1992) to the cyclopic Vele (1973-74), up to a new conception of orchestra, partially accomplished, in the project Venti (1980/82).

The construction of his non-instruments (which he rather defined as "closed systems") stemmed from his constant research into the genesis of sound. He studied with Goffredo Petrassi, Bruno Maderna, and Gottfried Michael Koenig. Nonetheless, he drew his most personal poetics from John Cage's approach to listening and from Informal Art.

# 1.2 the master of the shadows: </br> dialogues

.dialogue[
**Menippo:** Hmm, I am beginning to smell complications. To begin with, it seems that
you’re avoiding like the plague the use of the word “instrument” when you
speak of the mysterious objects constructed by the Master of Shadows. Why?

**Bremonte:**  In order to correctly interpret the intentions of my friend. He told me
that he always felt a certain difficulty in appropriately defining his musical
constructions. The formula initially used by him, the expression “sound sculp-
tures,” by his own declaration made him pretty unhappy and also caused him
a few unpleasant misunderstandings.
]

???
To enter Bertoncini's world of rare balance between homo faber and homo sapiens that spent thirty years bending metal, building wind, sculpting silence: we must first meet his voices.
He wrote. He wrote a lot to think: He wrote many dialogues structured as internal conversations between invented personae.
Two main characters:
Bremonte, the breathing mountain, embodies creative restlessness, invention: the wind that moves toward what is not yet.
Menippo, recalling the ancient satirist, is the voice of tradition, classical inquiry mixed with irony. He questions, tests, challenges.
Their exchange is pólemos—articulative tension.
Through them, Bertoncini's activity takes form as theatre of intellect where meaning emerges between voices, never settling into certainty.
For us, they became operational scores.

A (simple?) central question: What is a musical instrument? Is it an object, a tool, a technology? Or is it something else - a crystallization of compositional thought, a space where sound is already “written” before any performer touches it?

In his dialogical writings, Bertoncini’s character Bremonte makes a radical claim: his assemblages resist being called “instruments.”

Why? Listen carefully to his words:

> «…the sonic material is “sculpted”, that is, set in a formally significant way, not in the act of performing a series of musical gestures scattered along the time-axis but in the moment of the construction of the object.»

This is a fundamental reconception. Traditional instruments are open systems- awaiting human intention, infinitely adaptable across repertoires and styles.

Bertoncini’s sound sculptures are closed systems - limited configurations where sonic possibility is inscribed into physical form during construction.

This is why he resists calling them “instruments.” They’re not tools for making any music - they’re specific sonic worlds made material.

The product of a composition is the object itself.

???
Central to this is Bertoncini's concept of the leggio - the music stand. from the Greek λογεῖον ‘pulpit, tribune’, crossed with the medieval Latin legivum or legium, used in the sense of ‘place from which one reads’.

opzione A:
In his work, the leggio operates simultaneously as: the sound sculpture itself, the assemblage of sculptures, the musical score, and the dialogical writing. This stratification embodies McLuhan's "the medium is the message": the leggio is a form that informs. This music can only be completely understood by playing it through workshop practice, listening with your hands.

opzione B:
But what stands on it? The sculpture itself is text. The assemblage of sculptures is arrangement of texts. The score, when it exists, is "a letter to an unknown recipient." And the dialogues—are they not also leggio?
This stratification embodies McLuhan's "the medium is the message": the leggio is a form that informs.
To remain faithful to this music, we must play it through workshop practice.

Which brings us to the heart of Bertoncini's practice: the bottega - the workshop as pedagogy, as research method, as social form.

The bottega, from Greek 'apothḗkē' and Latin 'apotheca' (storehouse), was in the Renaissance a space for embodied transmission—where knowledge came from shared practice, not detached theory. Thinking happened through making.

Between 1968 and 1975, Bertoncini articulated his vision in a manifesto: "Per una bottega d'Arte dei nostri giorni" - "For an Art Workshop of our times."

His diagnosis was sharp. He wrote that modern society increasingly forces individuals into passive consumption. The progressive decline of artisanship inevitably diminishes individual initiative and, therefore, imagination, the faculty of invention.

He articulated the Bottega dell'Arte through five principles:

He articulated the Bottega dell'Arte through five principles: artists organizing their own instruments and materials,
free from commercial constraints; true interdisciplinary work from conception; artisanal invention
resolving the gap between technological possibility and academic formulas; learning and making unified rather than separated;
and collective engagement around a shared place of listening.

This vision materialized in Montreal (1975-77), where Bertoncini directed the Musical Design Course at McGill University.
The most intensive bottega activity came earlier in Berlin, 1973: for the first time, he had space for a proper artisan laboratory at DAAD Künstlerprogramm, developing his aeolian systems through collaborative research with technician Guido Guiducci in Rome, students in Montreal, and visiting artists.

???
All of this converged in Bertoncini's most ambitious project: Venti (1982). Forty performers, twenty aeolian sculptures—an orchestral utopia never achieved. The necessary impossible.
Crucially, in his late writings, Bertoncini reimagined Venti as a bottega project, requiring performers to traverse the entire constructive process—from acoustic laws to building objects—to "shed the traces of what's already been said, already been done."

For us as interpreters, Venti became our threshold. When Valeska Bertoncini asked us to study this unfinished piece, we realized: setting up a workshop was continuing Bertoncini's method—his vision that the work exists only through collective making. It's the first step in reactivating utopia as a method.

# 2.4 preservation

*LAZZARO - 220925*

]

???
But here emerges our central problem: How do we preserve work whose practice was tied almost exclusively to the author's living activity?
Bertoncini spent three decades developing embodied techniques not fully documented. His piezoelectric crystals, air compression systems, the non-intruments components...
all constitute a form of technological writing that has become, in many ways, hard to maintain.

This philosophical and interpretative challenge requires understanding preservation not as freezing but as creative re-mediation: preserving his research questions, his non-instrument by playng it, methods, utopias—continuing the bottega as living practice.

???
Our interpretative approach draws from three stratified sources—but first, a practical foundation: the instruments required significant maintenance to become playable again. This restoration work itself became research.
First source: direct transmission—working with those who shared Bertoncini's practice. Two of us, Giuseppe and Leonardo, worked directly with him, sharing concert experiences: though not on these pieces, this embodied knowledge informs our journey.
Second: written materials—scores, specifications, and his dialogical writings.
Third: the instruments themselves as texts to be read through experimentation.
This stratification requires combining archival study with active technical investigation—not reconstructing a fixed past but continuing open research.

We work as LAZZARO, a laboratory protocol that emerged from LEAP - Laboratorio ElettroAcustico Permanente - our Rome-based workshop space, established in December 2020.

LEAP is paradox incarnated: physical place and permanent utopia. ElettroAcustico because it stands in the history of Roman musical research, finding in listening the place of union between technology and acoustic instruments. Permanent, not as a fixed location but as a social object, permanent in the people who animate it. LEAP - the leap we make with thought following intuition.

???
LAZZARO is the phenomenon manifesting from LEAP’s movement. We are not a fixed ensemble but a laboratory protocol founded in 2023 for reactivating experimental repertoires from the twentieth century.
Lazzaro wakes up and continues the investigations left open by composers like Bertoncini. Performance is not representation but continuation of research, shared with people.
LAZZARO operates as a bridge between two islands: instrument and writing - continuously observing both to map an idea of musical making that articulates the research process rather than achieving a predetermined end.

# 3.4 leap -> lazzaro -> bottega

![](img/leap-lazzaro.png)

???
This diagram maps what we call WORKSHIP - a neologism combining workshop (Italian bottega), fellowship, and ship (navigation through unknown waters). Workship is simultaneously the material place of work, temporal condition of working together, devotion to the work itself and the journey through unknown waters.
Five practices form a continuous cycle: POÏETICS, the metabolic activity maintaining creation open. INTER-PRETIUM, hermetic mediation between dimensions. INTER-PROBLEMATICS—our research multiplies problems rather than solving them, maintaining tensions like Bertoncini's dialogical voices. OPERACTIVITY sustains the tension between opera as sign oriented to the past and operazione as process oriented to the future—this tension is the duration of art itself. Finally, INCOMMUNICABILITY: recognizing what remains irreducibly singular, what resists communication and generates interpretation.


Cutting vertically through these practices runs a fundamental tension: use-useless: USELESS ascending—Bertoncini's "other useless things," utopic space, gravitational escape toward the impossible-necessary. And USE grounding—praxis, making-work, gravitational pull toward application. Without practice, the useless remains abstract. WORKSHIP maintains both forces without collapsing either.
Five practitioners—Alice, Marco, Giuseppe, Davide, Leonardo—move through all practices in dynamic circulation. The fellowship is the social form keeping these practices alive.
What this reveals: sustainable preservation means treating maintenance as interpretation, and interpretation as continuation of the composer's research questions.

Our WORKSHIP conducted its first provisional synthesis on September 22, 2025, at Goethe-Institut Rome: "LAZZARO in Ripresa di Venti," featuring seven historical sound sculptures.
We approached this as istantanea—snapshot and instantaneous. Freezing a moment in ongoing research while remaining open to future iterations.
The concert’s function shifts from definitive presentation to provisional output - one frame in a film still being shot, one archaeological layer in a dig still ongoing.

Setting up the concert pushed us to decide whether to start with thinking or tinkering.
On the one hand, the music we were approaching was the least known that the author wrote. On the other hand, the technological needs seemed blocking any attempt to play.

The cycle Istantanee took us from simply listening to the original installation of a circular harp exposed to the wind of the first piece, to the unwritten instrumental actions of the second piece, and finally to Istantanee III, which combines live actions on the harp, pre-recorded tracks, and real-time electronic-digital manipulation.

The string quartet was first performed in Darmstadt in 1992 and only once more in Berlin. We had no video, just a poor audio recording and a few people who remembered it. It features a traditional score which challenges the classical quartet form by hiding indeterminacy in conventionally notated movements and unexpected prescriptiveness in the graphically scored sections.

To help with this, we reached out to Ulrich Maiss, the cellist who played one of the four Lyras des Aeolus, in the original quartet and who premiered another piece of Bertoncini, Elementi di Forma, which continues the instrumental experimentation begun with the Streichquartett. This conveyed us a processual idea of these objects, their origin and their direction.

Approaching Venti was even more intricate: no score, no recordings, only sketches and the dialogues. Nonetheless, by studying what we found, we realized that the author revised the project several times, adapting it to the human and technical circumstances. In fact, in the text “In ripresa di Venti”, Bertoncini imagined setting up a workshop << suitable for combining my old idea of a ‘Bottega d’Arte’ with the need to involve the performers of Venti in the construction of those sound objects >>

# 4.4 operactivity

![](img/operactivity.png)

???
In all three pieces, the technology was the most urgent thing to figure out. We needed a new compressed air system (with cylinders, hoses, outlets, and gauges for high pressure), an amplification setup that could continue the author’s research, and a playing technique that considered technology, artistic ideas, and group dynamics.

These requirements sketched a cyclic graph of dependencies that pushed the teamwork in all directions at once.

The instruments bridge is the technical element that embodies all these different efforts, being an impedance adapter, thus a metaphor of our action, that matches different impedances: acoustic, electrical, or human differences that characterize the conditions of sound production.

Therefore, we can use the bridge as a case study to analyze the “operactivity” paradigm that informed the process of setting up the equipment within our “bottega”.

First of all, this process draws on various sources: the bridges we found, the published dialogues, and everything constitutes the “legacy” of Mario Bertoncini - manuscripts and sketches, our exchanges with other performers and with Valeska.
The constant review of sources fuels the conjectures and validates them, along with the reflection on our practice sessions.

In stringed instruments, the bridge generally connects the strings to the soundboard: in the aeolian harp, however, the five bridges float, and the soundboard is missing. The resonance function is implemented by the electroacoustic chain, which is an integral part of the instrument. As a result, we applied the sensor directly on the bridge. As for the Streichquartett Lyras, the woodblock acts as a resonator, so we focused on extracting their voice from it.

Impedance, bandwidth, sensitivity, and ease of use are some of the issues Bertoncini encountered while choosing his electrical solution, << an acceptable and inevitable compromise >>, and the same we are considering today to design a customised bridge that can also facilitate the operation of a sensor.
In fact, to avoid using the original electrical components – fragile, partially deteriorated, and no longer commercially available -- we opted for setting up our custom configuration of piezoelectric discs that could pick up vibrations from both sides of the bridge, which we made from plywood for the harp, matching its impedance with an analogue mixer. At the same time, we imagined how each component could be redesigned later on, by using metal bridges, resistors, and customised circuits.

Besides producing artifacts, the “operactivity” paradigm leaves “workshop notes” on various media that document choices, results and expectations.
As the graph shows, these notes constitute the catalogue and the actions log.

In Fondazione Scelsi, we found a myriad of components collected by Bertoncini that resembled us Cage’s preparation kits, only without instructions. So, as we discovered the purpose of each object, we catalogued it and decided whether to maintain and reuse it or rebuild it.

These choices are documented in the actions log, which reveals a simple “durability” protocol: if the item in question was long-lasting, we reused it. Otherwise, when the item was subject to deterioration, we decided to produce an updated version, re-mediating it.

What clearly motivates the “operactivity” methodology is posing a question to posterity.

What would benefit a future community of musicians? A catalogue transformed into an archive? A bridge capable of directly capturing vibrations? A lighter instrument with new strings and a new tuning system?

These and other questions are driving our methods, which sustain uselessness as a principle of non-instrumentality of our action and of any action involving technology not as a means to an end, but as the result of a collective mediation.
