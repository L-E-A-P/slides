Thank you for giving us this opportunity to present a report of our study of interpretation and re-mediation of Mario Bertoncini's work. My name is Marco Di Gasbarro, and
-first of all I'll summarize who is Mario Bertoncini and where are we getting information about him
-secondly Alice will tell us why Bertoncini's activity is already mediated in his works, his poetics and his praxis, thanks to the idea of a continuous workshop: botteghe d'arte. An idea which raised questions about preservation and sustainability
-then she will present our question-based approach, how the interpretative practice shared in Lazzaro offers a necessary response, even if not a sufficient solution
-in the fourth chapter I will show you some excerpts of our re-mediation, performed on september 22nd at Goethe Institut in Rome
-then we'll open the workshop note-book, where our version of the bottega is expressed by a process we've called "operactivity"
-finally we will get to uselessness and why it can be useful to us

We would like to thank Valeska Bertoncini - Mario's work hier and curator -, Fondazione Isabella Scelsi in Rome, where Bertoncini's instruments are kept safe and Akademie der Kunste in Berlin, where all the writings and scores are archived.
Mario Bertoncini's work spans from awarded interpretations of Scarlatti's piano sonatas and Debussy's works (in the 50s), to the prepared piano of Cage's Sonatas et Interludes. From a creative point of view, he explored the full spectrum of compositional techniques, from traditional paper scoring to the most experimental practices of device construction: *sound sculptures* that ranged from found objects to electric motors to wind harps. He produced theatre pieces (Spazio-Tempo, 1967-70, Illegonda, 1968), installations (Chain Reaction, 1973, in collab. with kinetic painter Peter Sedgley) instrumental solo (Chanson pour instruments à vent, 1974, Istantanee, 1975-2008), small ensemble (Epitaffio, Tune for suspended cymbals), featuring sculptures of various size, from the Aeolian Lyras (Streichquartett, 1992) to the cyclopic Vele (1973-74), up to a new conception of orchestra, partially accomplished, in the project of Venti (1980/82), which envisaged 40 performers on 20 sound aggregates.
The construction of his non-instruments (he rather defined them as "closed systems" for a reason we'll address later on) required and benefitted of his constant research on the genesis of sound. He studied with Goffredo Petrassi, Bruno Maderna and Gottfried Michael Koenig. Nonetheless, he drew his most personal poetics from John Cage's approach to listening.

# what is a musical instrument?

???
Alice: Thank you Marco. Let me begin with a question that might seem simple but opens everything we'll discuss today:
What is a musical instrument?
Is it an object? A tool? A technology? Or is it something else - a crystallization of compositional thought, a space where sound is already "written" before any performer touches it?

# "non-instruments"

???
In his dialogical writings, Bertoncini's character Bremonte makes a radical claim: his assemblages resist being called "instruments."
Why? Listen carefully to his words:
"The sound, the sonic matter, would be sculpted - disposed in a formally significant way - not at the moment of executing musical gestures ordered in time, but at the moment of constructing the object."

This is a fundamental reconception of musical materiality. Traditional instruments are open systems- awaiting human intention, infinitely adaptable across repertoires and styles.
Bertoncini's sound sculptures are closed systems - limited, finite configurations where sonic possibility is inscribed into physical form during construction. The sound is already "sculpted" before performance. The object itself is already composition.
This is why he resists calling them "instruments." They're not tools for making any music - they're specific sonic worlds made material.

[…] _extra?_

But this raises another question: If the object is already composition, what remains for the performer to do?
Are we simply "activating" a pre-composed mechanism? Are we servants to the object's will? Or is something more complex happening?

Bertoncini provides a startling answer. He wrote:
"Every time I define a score graphically or verbally, I don't dictate the only interpretation of the object, but only one of the multiple interpretations of it - I am therefore one of the many possible interpreters of my own composition."
The composer becomes one interpreter among many. Not hierarchy between author and performer, but a community of operators - those who make the work operate, who put it back into operation.

### what is it?

- The sound sculpture itself <br/> the object to be read
- The assemblage of sculptures <br/> the disposition of the text
- The musical score <br/> notation, graphic signs, instructions
- The dialogical writing <br/> reflection on the work
]

???
Central to understanding this is Bertoncini's concept we have to speak about the leggìo.
From Latin lectorium, "to read" - the place where what must be read is disposed. But in Bertoncini's work, the leggio operates on multiple levels simultaneously:
* The sound sculpture itself - the object to be read
* The assemblage of sculptures - the disposition of the text
* The musical score - notation, graphic signs, instructions
* The dialogical writing - reflection on the work
This stratification literally embodies McLuhan's "the medium is the message." The leggio is form that informs. And in McLuhan's circular logic where "the content of the book is the reader," Bertoncini's complexity reveals a paradigm:
This music can only be completely heard, and completely understood, by playing it.
Going through the workshop practice. Listening with your hands. Thinking through material.

This open us to Mario Bertoncini’s poiesis - from Greek poíēsis, "to make, to bring into being." the continuous activity of being into making, the force oriented toward what-is-not-yet.

Which brings us to the heart of Bertoncini's practice: the bottega - the workshop as pedagogy, as research method, as social form.
The bottega, from Greek apothḗkē through Latin apotheca, means "storehouse" - but the Renaissance bottega was something specific: a space of embodied transmission where knowledge was acquired through shared practice, not separated theoretical speculation. A place where thinking happened through making.

Between 1968 and 1975, Bertoncini articulated his vision in a manifesto: "Per una bottega d'Arte dei nostri giorni" - "For an Art Workshop of our times."
His diagnosis was sharp. He wrote that modern society increasingly forces individuals into passive consumption. That the progressive decline of artisanship inevitably diminishes individual initiative and therefore imagination, the faculty of invention. That musical disciplines are daily more conditioned by commercial mechanisms - not only in the consumption of musical objects but especially in the design and construction of instruments, which are created exclusively for certain types of consumption.

Listen to his central claim:
"The one who acts, the artist, should not only be confronted with the basic theoretical principles of their chosen discipline. It would be of capital importance if they were themselves practically able to organize with absolute freedom their own instruments - that is, the materials necessary for realizing the object - and to master in the finest details the relative techniques."

# five principles

#### 1. artisanal freedom

#### 2. interdisciplinary platform

#### 3. invention over codification

#### 4. learning-as-making

#### 5. social engagement

???
1. Artisanal freedom <br/>
   Artists must be able to organize their own instruments, master their materials, free from commercial constraints
2. Interdisciplinary platform <br/>
   Composer, visual artist, theater-maker working together from initial conception, not assembled in emergency afterward
3. Invention over codification <br/>
   Using artisanal means, non-codified but tied to invention, to resolve the contradiction between technological possibility and rigid academic formulas
4. Learning-as-making <br/>
   Simultaneous act where learning and doing, abstract doctrine and production, are united instead of separated as in institutional education
5. Social engagement <br/>
   Participating in a collective that acts in common agreement, connected to a "place of listening" where people gather for love of the object itself

This vision found concrete form in Montreal, 1975-77, where Bertoncini directed the Musical Design Course at McGill University.
Charles De Mestral, one of his students, remembered: "His indications were above all negative: no obvious harmonic or melodic structure, no periodic rhythm, no formulas recalling old or avant-garde styles."
This negative pedagogy created space for students - and materials themselves - to discover what they wanted to become. Let the musical idea "make its own path, impose its requirements, and direct the search for means."

# «it was really like being an apprentice <br/> in a 15th-century workshop.»

But the most intensive realization came earlier. Berlin, 1973: for the first time, Bertoncini had space for a proper artisan laboratory at the DAAD Künstlerprogramm.
There Bertoncini developed his electroacoustic systems - aeolian harps with piezoelectric pickups, custom preamplifiers, carefully calibrated air compression. This wasn't isolated genius but collaborative research: with technician Guido Guiducci in Rome, with students in Montreal, with visiting artists in Berlin.
The bottega as living laboratory.
