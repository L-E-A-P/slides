Thank you for letting us share our report on how we interpret and re-mediate Mario Bertoncini's work. My name is Marco Di Gasbarro.

* To begin, I will briefly introduce Mario Bertoncini and point out where you can find more information about him.
* Building on that, Alice will explain the extent to which Bertoncini's activity is already mediated in his works, poetics, and praxis by the concept of the continuous workshop - the “botteghe d'arte” - an approach that, in turn, prompts questions of preservation and sustainability.
* She will then introduce our question-based approach and show how our interpretative practice in Lazzaro offers a necessary response, even if it does not fully solve the problem.
* Next, I will share excerpts from our concert, focusing on the process that frames it, which we carried out on September 22 at the Goethe-Institut in Rome.
* After sharing these excerpts, we will open the workshop notebook, introduce our version of the bottega, clarify how our approach unfolds, and explain the objectives of the process we call "operactivity."
* Finally, we will discuss the idea of uselessness and explore how it might actually help us.

We would like to thank Valeska Bertoncini - Mario's work heiress and curator -, Fondazione Isabella Scelsi in Rome, where Bertoncini's instruments are kept, and Akademie der Künste in Berlin, where all the writings and scores are archived.

Mario Bertoncini's work spans from awarded interpretations of Scarlatti's piano sonatas and Debussy's works, to the prepared piano of Cage's Sonatas et Interludes. He explored the full spectrum of compositional techniques, from traditional notation to the most experimental practices of device construction: *sound sculptures* that ranged from found objects to electric motors to wind harps. He produced theatre pieces (Spazio-Tempo, 1967-70), installations (Chain Reaction, 1973, in collab. with kinetic painter Peter Sedgley) instrumental solo (Istantanee, 1975-2008), small ensemble (Epitaffio, 1968), featuring sculptures of various size, from the Aeolian Lyras (Streichquartett, 1992) to the cyclopic Vele (1973-74), up to a new conception of orchestra, partially accomplished, in the project of Venti (1980/82), which envisaged 40 performers on 20 sound aggregates.

The construction of his non-instruments (which he rather defined as "closed systems" for a reason we'll address later) required and benefited from his constant research into the genesis of sound. He studied with Goffredo Petrassi, Bruno Maderna, and Gottfried Michael Koenig. Nonetheless, he drew his most personal poetics from John Cage's approach to listening.

# instruments or non-instruments?

???
Thank you, Marco. Let me begin with a question that might seem simple but opens everything we’ll discuss today: What is a musical instrument? Is it an object? A tool? A technology? Or is it something else - a crystallization of compositional thought, a space where sound is already “written” before any performer touches it?

In his dialogical writings, Bertoncini’s character Bremonte makes a radical claim: his assemblages resist being called “instruments.”

Why? Listen carefully to his words:

> «…the sonic material is “sculpted”, that is, set in a formally significant way, not in the act of performing a series of musical gestures scattered along the time-axis but in the moment of the construction of the object.»

This is a fundamental reconception of musical materiality. Traditional instruments are open systems- awaiting human intention, infinitely adaptable across repertoires and styles.

Bertoncini’s sound sculptures are closed systems - limited, finite configurations where sonic possibility is inscribed into physical form during construction.

This is why he resists calling them “instruments.” They’re not tools for making any music - they’re specific sonic worlds made material.

The product of a composition is the object itself.

### what is it?

- The sound sculpture itself <br/> the object to be read
- The assemblage of sculptures <br/> the disposition of the text
- The musical score <br/> notation, graphic signs, instructions
- The dialogical writing <br/> reflection on the work

Central to understanding this is Bertoncini's concept we have to speak about the leggìo.
From Latin lectorium, "to read" - the place where what must be read is disposed. But in Bertoncini's work, the leggio operates on multiple levels simultaneously:
* The sound sculpture itself - the object to be read
* The assemblage of sculptures - the disposition of the text
* The musical score - notation, graphic signs, instructions
* The dialogical writing - reflection on the work
This stratification literally embodies McLuhan's "the medium is the message." The leggio is form that informs. And in McLuhan's circular logic where "the content of the book is the reader," Bertoncini's complexity reveals a paradigm:
This music can only be completely heard, and completely understood, by playing it.
Going through the workshop practice. Listening with your hands. Thinking through material.

This open us to Mario Bertoncini’s poiesis - from Greek poíēsis, "to make, to bring into being." the continuous activity of being into making, the force oriented toward what-is-not-yet.

Which brings us to the heart of Bertoncini's practice: the bottega - the workshop as pedagogy, as research method, as social form.
The bottega, from Greek apothḗkē through Latin apotheca, means "storehouse" - but the Renaissance bottega was something specific: a space of embodied transmission where knowledge was acquired through shared practice, not separated theoretical speculation. A place where thinking happened through making.

Between 1968 and 1975, Bertoncini articulated his vision in a manifesto: "Per una bottega d'Arte dei nostri giorni" - "For an Art Workshop of our times."
His diagnosis was sharp. He wrote that modern society increasingly forces individuals into passive consumption. That the progressive decline of artisanship inevitably diminishes individual initiative and therefore imagination, the faculty of invention. That musical disciplines are daily more conditioned by commercial mechanisms - not only in the consumption of musical objects but especially in the design and construction of instruments, which are created exclusively for certain types of consumption.

Listen to his central claim:
"The one who acts, the artist, should not only be confronted with the basic theoretical principles of their chosen discipline. It would be of capital importance if they were themselves practically able to organize with absolute freedom their own instruments - that is, the materials necessary for realizing the object - and to master in the finest details the relative techniques."

# five principles

#### 1. artisanal freedom

#### 2. interdisciplinary platform

#### 3. invention over codification

#### 4. learning-as-making

#### 5. social engagement

???
1. Artisanal freedom <br/>
   Artists must be able to organize their own instruments, master their materials, free from commercial constraints
2. Interdisciplinary platform <br/>
   Composer, visual artist, theater-maker working together from initial conception, not assembled in emergency afterward
3. Invention over codification <br/>
   Using artisanal means, non-codified but tied to invention, to resolve the contradiction between technological possibility and rigid academic formulas
4. Learning-as-making <br/>
   Simultaneous act where learning and doing, abstract doctrine and production, are united instead of separated as in institutional education
5. Social engagement <br/>
   Participating in a collective that acts in common agreement, connected to a "place of listening" where people gather for love of the object itself

This vision found concrete form in Montreal, 1975-77, where Bertoncini directed the Musical Design Course at McGill University.
Charles De Mestral, one of his students, remembered: "His indications were above all negative: no obvious harmonic or melodic structure, no periodic rhythm, no formulas recalling old or avant-garde styles."
This negative pedagogy created space for students - and materials themselves - to discover what they wanted to become. Let the musical idea "make its own path, impose its requirements, and direct the search for means."

# «it was really like being an apprentice <br/> in a 15th-century workshop.»

But the most intensive realization came earlier. Berlin, 1973: for the first time, Bertoncini had space for a proper artisan laboratory at the DAAD Künstlerprogramm.
There Bertoncini developed his electroacoustic systems - aeolian harps with piezoelectric pickups, custom preamplifiers, carefully calibrated air compression. This wasn't isolated genius but collaborative research: with technician Guido Guiducci in Rome, with students in Montreal, with visiting artists in Berlin.
The bottega as living laboratory.
