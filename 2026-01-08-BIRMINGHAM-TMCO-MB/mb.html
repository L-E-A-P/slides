Thank you for letting us share our report on how we interpret and re-mediate Mario Bertoncini's work. My name is Marco Di Gasbarro.

* To begin, I will briefly introduce Mario Bertoncini and point out where you can find more information about him.
* Building on that, Alice will explain the extent to which Bertoncini's activity is already mediated in his works, poetics, and praxis by the concept of the continuous workshop - the “botteghe d'arte” - an approach that, in turn, prompts questions of preservation and sustainability.
* She will then introduce our question-based approach and show how our interpretative practice in Lazzaro offers a necessary response, even if it does not fully solve the problem.
* Next, I will share excerpts from our concert, focusing on the process that frames it, which we carried out on September 22 at the Goethe-Institut in Rome.
* After sharing these excerpts, we will open the workshop notebook, introduce our version of the bottega, clarify how our approach unfolds, and explain the objectives of the process we call "operactivity."
* Finally, we will discuss the idea of uselessness and explore how it might actually help us.

We would like to thank Valeska Bertoncini - Mario's work heiress and curator -, Fondazione Isabella Scelsi in Rome, where Bertoncini's instruments are kept, and Akademie der Künste in Berlin, where all the writings and scores are archived.

Mario Bertoncini's work spans from interpretations of Scarlatti's piano sonatas and Debussy's works to the prepared piano of Cage's Sonatas et Interludes. He explored the full spectrum of compositional techniques, from traditional notation to the most experimental practices of device construction: *sound sculptures* that ranged from found objects to electric motors to wind harps. He produced theatre pieces (Spazio-Tempo, 1967-70), installations (Chain Reaction, 1973, in collab. with kinetic painter Peter Sedgley) instrumental solo (Istantanee, 1975-2008), small ensemble (Epitaffio, 1968), featuring sculptures of various size, from the Aeolian Lyras (Streichquartett, 1992) to the cyclopic Vele (1973-74), up to a new conception of orchestra, partially accomplished, in the project of Venti (1980/82), which envisaged 40 performers on 20 sound aggregates.

The construction of his non-instruments (which he rather defined as "closed systems" for a reason we'll address later) required and benefited from his constant research into the genesis of sound. He studied with Goffredo Petrassi, Bruno Maderna, and Gottfried Michael Koenig. Nonetheless, he drew his most personal poetics from John Cage's approach to listening.

# 1.2 dialogues

???
To understand how we approach this challenge, we must first capture Bertoncini’s unique analytical method: his dialogical writings, structured as internal conversations between invented personae.

Take Bremonte - from bre- (breath, breeze) and monte (mountain). He embodies creative restlessness, invention, and the generative impulse toward what is not yet.
Menippo recalls the ancient Greek satirist who created the Menippean satire - mixing serious philosophical inquiry with irony. He represents tradition, classical investigation, and the voice that questions and tests.

Their dialogue isn’t conflict but productive tension - what the Greeks called pólemos, articulative rather than destructive. As Bakhtin analyzed, the Menippean form allows “testing ideas through extreme situations,” mixing high and low, philosophy and comedy.

Through these characters, Bertoncini explored what Blanchot called “the essential solitude” of artistic work. The author becomes “X.” - the unknown, the incognita that must be sought but can never be fully known.

# 1.3 instruments or non-instruments?

???
Thank you, Marco. I'll start with a central question: What is a musical instrument? Is it an object, a tool, a technology? Or is it something else - a crystallization of compositional thought, a space where sound is already “written” before any performer touches it?

In his dialogical writings, Bertoncini’s character Bremonte makes a radical claim: his assemblages resist being called “instruments.”

Why? Listen carefully to his words:

> «…the sonic material is “sculpted”, that is, set in a formally significant way, not in the act of performing a series of musical gestures scattered along the time-axis but in the moment of the construction of the object.»

This is a fundamental reconception of musical materiality. Traditional instruments are open systems- awaiting human intention, infinitely adaptable across repertoires and styles.

Bertoncini’s sound sculptures are closed systems - limited, finite configurations where sonic possibility is inscribed into physical form during construction.

This is why he resists calling them “instruments.” They’re not tools for making any music - they’re specific sonic worlds made material.

The product of a composition is the object itself.

Central to this is Bertoncini's concept of the leggio - the music stand. from the Greek λογεῖον ‘pulpit, tribune’, crossed with the medieval Latin legivum or legium, used in the sense of ‘place from which one reads’. In his work, the leggio operates simultaneously as: the sound sculpture itself, the assemblage of sculptures, the musical score, and the dialogical writing. This stratification embodies McLuhan's "the medium is the message": the leggio is a form that informs. This music can only be completely understood by playing it through workshop practice, listening with your hands.

Which brings us to the heart of Bertoncini's practice: the bottega - the workshop as pedagogy, as research method, as social form.

The bottega, from Greek 'apothḗkē' and Latin 'apotheca' (storehouse), was in the Renaissance a space for embodied transmission—where knowledge came from shared practice, not detached theory. Thinking happened through making.

Between 1968 and 1975, Bertoncini articulated his vision in a manifesto: "Per una bottega d'Arte dei nostri giorni" - "For an Art Workshop of our times."

His diagnosis was sharp. He wrote that modern society increasingly forces individuals into passive consumption. The progressive decline of artisanship inevitably diminishes individual initiative and, therefore, imagination, the faculty of invention.

Five principles

He would address the Bottega through five principles:

1. Artisanal freedom <br/>
   Artists must be able to organize their own instruments, master their materials, and be free from commercial constraints
2. Interdisciplinary platform <br/>
   Composer, visual artist, theatre-maker working together from initial conception, not assembled in an emergency afterward
3. Invention over codification <br/>
   Using artisanal means, non-codified but tied to invention, to resolve the contradiction between technological possibility and rigid academic formulas
4. Learning-as-making <br/>
   Simultaneous act where learning and doing, abstract doctrine and production, are united instead of separated as in institutional education
5. Social engagement <br/>
   Participating in a collective that acts in common agreement, connected to a "place of listening" where people gather for love of the object itself

This vision found concrete form in Montreal, 1975-77, where Bertoncini directed the Musical Design Course at McGill University.

Charles De Mestral, one of his students, remembered:

> His indications were above all negative: no obvious harmonic or melodic structure, no periodic rhythm, no formulas recalling old or avant-garde styles.

This negative pedagogy created space for students - and materials themselves - to discover what they wanted to become. Let the musical idea "make its own path, impose its requirements, and direct the search for means."

But the most intensive realization came earlier. Berlin, 1973: for the first time, Bertoncini had space for a proper artisan laboratory at the DAAD Künstlerprogramm.

There, Bertoncini developed his electroacoustic systems - aeolian harps with piezoelectric pickups, custom preamplifiers, and carefully calibrated air compression. This was collaborative research with technician Guido Guiducci in Rome, with students in Montreal, and with visiting artists in Berlin.

]
]

???
All of this - the non-instruments, the closed systems, the bottega pedagogy - converged in Bertoncini's most ambitious project: Venti (1982).

The vision: forty performers, twenty aeolian sculptures, an orchestral utopia: never achieved. The necessary impossible.

And crucially, in his late writings (Dialogue XIV), Bertoncini reimagined Venti not as a fixed composition but as a *bottega* project. He wrote that reviving it would require:

Conjugating my old idea of an Art Workshop with the need to involve the performers of Venti in the construction of those sound objects themselves.

Only by traversing the entire constructive process - from learning acoustic laws to building specific objects - could performers truly "shed the traces of what's already been said, already been done."

For LAZZARO, Venti became our threshold - the door through which we entered Bertoncini's work.
When Valeska Bertoncini asked us to study this "famous unfinished piece," we realized: setting up a workshop was the continuation of Bertoncini's own method - his vision that the work could only exist through collective making, through bottega practice.

Ripresa di Venti (2025) isn't a reconstruction of the impossible 40-performer version. It's the first step in reactivating utopia as a method.

# 2.4

???
But here emerges our central problem: How do we preserve work whose practice was tied almost exclusively to the author's living activity?

Bertoncini spent three decades developing embodied techniques that were not fully documented. Building electroacoustic chains with components now obsolete or unavailable. The piezoelectric crystals he used - natural crystal microphones with very high impedance - are no longer manufactured. His amplification designs require specific circuitry. The precise pickup placement, pressure calibration, and air compression systems - all constitute a form of technological writing that has become, in many ways, illegible.

This is a philosophical and interpretative challenge that requires us to understand preservation not as freezing but as creative re-mediation.
Preservation of Bertoncini's work must be the preservation of his research questions, his methods, his utopias: the continuation of the bottega as living practice.

# 3.1 three forms of orality:

.col-1[

1. Primary orality
2. Secondary orality

]

???
Our interpretative approach engages three stratified forms of orality:

1. Primary orality - direct experience of those who performed with Bertoncini, embodied knowledge passed through working together
2. Secondary orality - musical notation and scores, graphic instructions, technical specifications
3. Indirect orality - communication through dialogical writing, where meaning emerges between voices
This stratification is crucial. Bertoncini’s writings don’t explain the work - they extend it, opening research questions about modes of sound production, instrument-performer relations, and what constitutes a musical “work.” These are questions requiring both archival study and active technical-interpretative investigation.

# 3.2 leap

## laboratorio elettroacustico permanente, roma

![](img/2024-01-13-adp-06.jpg)

???
LAZZARO emerged from LEAP - Laboratorio ElettroAcustico Permanente - our Rome-based workshop space, established in December 2020 in the Appio Latino quarter.

LEAP is paradox incarnated: physical place and permanent utopia. ElettroAcustico because it stands in the history of Roman musical research, finding in listening the place of union between technology and acoustic instruments. Permanent, not as a fixed location but as a social object, permanent in the people who animate it. LEAP - the leap we make with thought following intuition.

# 3.3 lazzaro

![](img/LAZZARO_130825_0008.jpg)

???
LAZZARO is the phenomenon manifesting from LEAP’s movement. We are not a fixed ensemble but a laboratory protocol founded in 2023 for reactivating experimental repertoires from the twentieth century.
The name carries meaning: Lazarus, raised from death. Lazzaro wakes up and continues the investigations left open by composers like Bertoncini. Performance is not representation but continuation of research, shared with people.
LAZZARO operates as a bridge between two islands: instrument and writing - continuously observing both geographies to map an idea of musical making that articulates the research process rather than achieving a predetermined end.

# 3.4 leap -> lazzaro -> bottega

![](img/leap-lazzaro.pdf)

???
This diagram maps what we call WORKSHIP - a neologism combining workshop (the Italian bottega, the artisan’s studio), fellowship (the communal dimension), and ship(navigation through unknown waters).

At the center stands WORKSHIP - simultaneously:

* The material place of work
* The temporal condition of working together
* The navigational practice - journey through unknown waters
* The devotion to the work itself

Around this center, five practices form a continuous cycle, simultaneous dimensions of the work:

1. POÏETICS - the act of bringing forth. The force oriented toward the future, the metabolic activity that maintains creation open.
2. INTER-PRETIUM - From Latin interpres, “one who goes between.” The hermetic mediation.
3. INTER-PROBLEMATICS - From Greek próblēma, “obstacle thrown forward.” Problems are never singular but always interwoven, thrown between people and practices. Our research operates through problem-multiplication rather than problem-solving. Like Bertoncini’s Bremonte and Menippo, we maintain tensions rather than dissolve them.
4. OPERACTIVITY - The activity that sustains tension between opera (work as sign, oriented toward the past) and operazione (operation as process, a poetic sígnale, oriented toward the future). Operactivity is the duration of art itself - maintaining this tension without collapse.
5. INCOMMUNICABILITY - Not communication’s failure, but recognition of dimensions that remain irreducibly singular. What resists communication demands interpretation, generates the Hermetic movement.

Cutting vertically through these circular practices is a fundamental tension:
USELESS (ascending force) - Bertoncini’s title “Aeolian Harps and other useless things” positions the useless not as failure but as liberation from instrumental rationality. The space of utopia, of the “project suspended in air” that refuses to limit its scope “for the love of banal realism.” The gravitational escape toward the impossible-necessary.

USE (grounding force) - Not merely utility but praxis - the dimension of doing, of making-work. The gravitational pull toward application. But also the necessary ground: without use, without practice, the useless would be merely abstract.

The workshop must maintain both the useless vision and the used practice, without collapsing either into the other. This is the vertical tension that WORKSHIP holds.

Around WORKSHIP, five practitioners embody this circulation: Alice, Marco, Giuseppe, Davide, Leonardo.
Each moves through all five practices, but the diagram also suggests particular resonances - not fixed roles but dynamic positions in continuous movement. The fellowship is the social form that allows these practices to remain alive, to circulate.

What WORKSHIP reveals: sustainable preservation of technology-mediated works requires treating maintenance as interpretation, and interpretation as continuation of the composer’s research questions.
We preserve Bertoncini’s work not by freezing it but by keeping his questions alive - continuing the “repeated attempts” and “long sonic research not yet concluded” that Bremonte describes.

The workshop is not a museum but a living laboratory where five circular practices maintain the vertical tension between useless and use. Where each keyword is a threshold, a crossing-point between dimensions.

Our WORKSHIP conducted the first provisional synthesis on September 22, 2025, at the Goethe-Institut Rome, in “LAZZARO in Ripresa di Venti,” featuring seven historical sound sculptures.

We approached this concert as a provisional istantanea - snapshot. The Italian word means both “snapshot” and “instantaneous” - freezing a moment in ongoing research while remaining open to future iterations.
The concert’s function shifts from definitive presentation to provisional output - one frame in a film still being shot, one archaeological layer in a dig still ongoing.
